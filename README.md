# Overwhelming Odors

Overwhelming odors was created for the [Linux Game Jam 2018](https://itch.io/jam/linux-game-jam-2018), and is a simple game about inhaling pleasant fragrances and avoiding unpleasant smells.

The game has been tested with a wired Xbox 360 controller on Linux Mint KDE, but should hopefully work with other gamepads and other operating systems as well.

### Software

The game was developed using a variety of free and open-source source software:

- [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) - Game engine
- [Blender](https://godotengine.org/) - 3D creation suite
- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) - Continuous integration software
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Containerization platform
- [Butler](https://itch.io/docs/butler/) - Itch.io CLI upload tool

Big thanks to [GameDrivenDesign](https://github.com/GameDrivenDesign/docker-godot-export) for making the Docker image we use to export our game to desktop platforms and the web, and release it on GitHub and Itch.io.
